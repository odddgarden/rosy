## About Rosy

Rosy is a web application built with Laravel, designed to empower screenwriters by providing a platform to access and share screenplays online. It aims to address the challenge of limited resources and lack of exposure for filmmakers, particularly writers, by offering a centralized space for script discovery and collaboration.

## Problem Statement

In the world of filmmaking, especially for emerging writers, finding resources and gaining exposure for their work can be daunting. Traditional avenues for sharing and accessing screenplays are often limited, leaving many talented individuals struggling to showcase their creativity and connect with potential collaborators.

## Solution

Rosy serves as a solution to this problem by offering a user-friendly web platform where screenwriters can freely access a diverse range of screenplays and share their own work with a wider audience. By providing a centralized hub for script discovery and collaboration, Rosy aims to foster a vibrant community of aspiring and established writers alike.

## Current Work in Progress

1. Partnering with Film Festivals and Fellow Screenwriters:
   We're in discussions with various organizations for potential partnerships with film festivals. These partnerships will enable us to reach a wider audience and provide more opportunities for screenwriters to      showcase their work. Additionally, we're reaching out to fellow screenwriters to encourage collaboration and contribution to the platform.

2. Building a CI/CD Pipeline with AWS:
   We're in the process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services such as AWS CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, RDS, IAM, and S3. This pipeline will streamline our development and deployment process, allowing us     to deliver updates and new features to our users more efficiently.
